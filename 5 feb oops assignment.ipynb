    "Certainly! Here's a simple explanation of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Think of encapsulation like a gift box. It keeps things together and hides the details. In OOP, you group data (like a person's age) and functions (like calculating their age) that work on that data inside a \"box\" called a class. It helps keep things organized and prevents others from messing with the inside of the box directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is like using a TV remote without knowing how it works inside. In OOP, you create classes that represent real-world things, like a car or a dog. You only show the important parts (attributes and methods) that you need to use, and hide the complex details. It makes working with objects easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is like passing down traits from parents to children. In OOP, you can create a new class that \"inherits\" attributes and methods from an existing class. This saves time because you don't have to write everything from scratch. The new class can also add or change things if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is like using different keys to open the same lock. In OOP, different classes can have methods with the same name, but they might work differently. You can use these methods without worrying about which class you're using. It makes code more flexible and adaptable."
